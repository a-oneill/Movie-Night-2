# Movie Night Style Guide

## Principles
- Calm, minimalist interface with generous spacing and restrained colors.
- Typography-led hierarchy; minimal ornamentation; purposeful motion.

## Foundations
- Color: Neutral grayscale with one primary accent.
- Typography: System font stack; sizes 12–48 with 400/500/600 weights.
- Spacing: 24px minimum padding on interactive elements; 48px section spacing.
- Motion: Transitions under 300ms; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Components
- Buttons: Primary, secondary, ghost with consistent focus and hover states.
- Cards: Poster-first layout with metadata and subtle badges.
- Navbar: Simple, responsive, keyboard-accessible.
- Drawer: Watchlist panel with clear actions and feedback.

## Patterns

- Accessible forms with labels and error messages.
- Responsive grids scaling 2–5 columns across breakpoints.

## Design Tokens
